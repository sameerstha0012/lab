3. What's the output of the code below? Try to understand how it works as we explained in the class.

const fs = require('fs');


fs.readFile('hello.txt', () => {

    console.log('readFile....');

});

setTimeout(() => console.log('timeout'), 0);

setImmediate(() => console.log('Immediate'));

Answer:

Console Output:

If, readFile does not takes time and timeout is 0:
readFile....
timeout
Immediate

If, readFile does not takes time and timeout is > 0:
readFile....
Immediate
timeout

If, readFile takes time and timeout is > 0:
Immediate
timeout
readFile....

If, readFile takes time and timeout is 0:
timeout
Immediate
readFile....
