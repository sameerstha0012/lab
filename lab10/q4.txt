4. What's the output of the code below when running in Node.js? If for the same code running in browser, what's the output? Why is the output different?

var message = 'Hello World';

function logMessage() {

    console.log(this.message);

}

logMessage();

Answer:

Output by Browser: 'Hello World' // message become property of global object and is accessible inside function
Output by Node.js: undefined // In Node.js, variable declared does not has global scope: gives module scope
                                and this inside function refers to the global object
                                so global does not have message property and results in undefined
